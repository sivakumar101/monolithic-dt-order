# Developer Notes

For the order service to run locally, the ports and IP of these services needs to be passed into Docker as environment variables -AND- catalog, and customer services must be listening on the ports defined in this script.

## Pre-requisites

The following programs to be installed
* Java 1.8
* Maven
* Docker

## Build and Run Locally

1. run these commands
  ```
  ./mvnw clean package
  java -jar target/*.jar
  ```
2. access application at ```http://localhost:8080```

## quicktest

Use the provided Unix shell script that loops and calls the app URL.  Just call:

```./quicktest.sh <catalog base url>```

For example:

```./quicktest.sh http://localhost:8080```

## Build Docker Images and push images to a repository

Use the provided Unix shell scipt that will build the docker image and publish it. 

    Just call: `./buildpush.sh <REPOSITORY> <VERSION_TAG>`

    For example: `./buildpush.sh dtdemos 1`
